              <strong>Decemeber 2022 - </strong> I just finished a great run as
              software engineer at a startup called{" "}
              <strong>MIR Partners</strong>, working on a live music streaming
              platform called <strong>Sessions</strong>. I was working with{" "}
              <strong>Typescript</strong>, <strong>React Native</strong>, and{" "}
              <strong>Mobx State Tree</strong> to build new features to help up
              and coming artists generate more income. I collaborated with the
              backend team to design APIs, and implement a system of leveling,
              leagues, and tiers to gamify the process of growing as an artist.
              I worked with XCode and Android Studio to solve platform specific
              bugs. We were tasked with building a new app from scratch called{" "}
              <strong>Next Music</strong> with a 6 week timeline start to
              finish. My role was to implement a signup/login/password recovery
              system using <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Typescript</strong>,
              <strong>NextJS</strong>, <strong>ChakraUI</strong>, and{" "}
              <strong>MobX</strong>. I also implemented a flow for onboarding
              new artists, which involved writing custom React Hooks and
              leveraging MobX actions/views to keep components clean and simple.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before that I was a{" "}
              <strong>frontend developer at Microsoft</strong>, building and
              maintaining product pages for{" "}
              <a

                className={aboutStyles.aboutLink}
                href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/"
              >
                Microsoft Azure
              </a>
              . I had to quickly learn my way around a massive{" "}
              <strong>.NET</strong> application, and work with{" "}
              <strong>C#</strong> and <strong>Razor Views</strong> to make
              business critical updates. My team was responsible for managing
              milestone branches for events such as{" "}
              <strong>Microsoft Build</strong>, and <strong>Ignite</strong>.
              This involved juggling dozens of projects with{" "}
              <strong>Azure DevOps</strong>, building pages from{" "}
              <strong>Figma</strong> wireframes, using <strong>git</strong>{" "}
              tools (e.g. git bisect, git cherry-pick, git rebase) to resolve
              merge conflicts between multiple teams, and making urgent
              hotfixes. I was also responsible for updating the Azure homepage
              every month - a page which has millions of visitors weekly and
              drives Azure's roughly $20 billion dollars in profit per quarter.
